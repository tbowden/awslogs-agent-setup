# awslogs-agent-setup
Patch on AWS supplied script. For now, this repo is a reminder for me that I'd like to create a patch file on the AWS supplied (restrictive license) awslogs-agent-setup.py file (curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cloudwatch/downloads/latest/awslogs-agent-setup.py -O) so it can *maybe* work with alpine linux.
